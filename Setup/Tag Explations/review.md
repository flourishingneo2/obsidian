Aliases: [ "#review" ]
---
Review is added to almost all files, that are not for special occasions and definitely never need to be changed and only need to be looked at in specific scenarios. With the review tag, I can regularly review the cards, so I can continue writing on them or (if they are finished or don't need writing) look over them. For the dailys I can kinda review what I've done past days and weeks and shit.
