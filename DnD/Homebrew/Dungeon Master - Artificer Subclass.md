# Dungeon Master
A Dungeon Master is an expert at preparing the battlefield before the fight starts. He delights any location in a labyrinth of danger, misdirection and traps. Dungeon Masters always fight on their terms.

## Tool Proficiency (3rd level)
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with mason's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

## Dungeon Master Spells (3rd level)
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Artillerist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

### Dungeon Master Spells
| Artificer Level | Spell                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3rd             | alarm, snare                                                  |

| 9th             | glyph of warding, plant growth                                |
| 13th            | mordenkainen's private sanctum, mordenkainen's faithful hound |
| 17th            | cloudkill, wall of stone                                      |
## Arcane Traps (3rd level)
You can trap your prepared spells into arcane triggers. As an action, you can prepare a magical trap in an unoccupied 1-foot square within reach. When placing the trap, you cast one prepared spell into it, expending its spell slot (or a higher if you want to upcast the spell) and casting components. The trap's setup time is the spell's casting time plus 1 minute. As a trigger, choose either proximity (a creature entering the space) or a phrase to be spoken within 30ft of the trap. When a trap is triggered, the spell is cast using your artificer spellcasting modifiers. Area effects are centered on the trap. You can have a number of Arcane Traps equal to your Intelligence Modifier (minimum 1). Traps can be detected with a successfull Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC and disarmed with a successful Dexterity check using thieves' tools or another method determined by the DM.

## Architect of Intrigue (5th level)
As an action, you can create a semi-intelligent illusory creature or object no larger than a 10-foot cube, appearing anywhere within 60 feet. This illusion behaves according to simple commands (e.g., "run away screaming" or "stand perfectly still") and lasts for 1 minute or until dismissed. A creature that uses an action to examine it see through the illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. 

You can also cast hallucinatory terrain once per long rest without expending a spell slot or needing material components.

## Trap Synergy (9th level)
Your traps are now interconnected like a master-designed dungeon. When a creature triggers one of your Arcane Traps, you can choose to trigger one additional trap within 30 feet of the first as part of the same reaction. This second trap must have a stored spell of 2nd level or lower, and you can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier per long rest. 

## Dungeon Sovereign (15th level)
Your understanding of traps, puzzles and battlefield control is unparalleled. When initative is rolled, you can immediately designate a 10-foot radius area within 60 feet as your Lair Zone. While you are conscious and inside this area: 
- You can cast minor illusion, mold earth and thaumaturgy at will without expending spell slots or material components. 
- The zone is considered as difficult terrain for hostile creatures.
- You can move one of your Arcane Traps 5 feet as a bonus action each round, provided it remains within the zone.
Additionally, hostile creatures within 30 feet of one of your Arcane Traps have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks.
