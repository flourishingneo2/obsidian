# Concept
In general magic is just an energy form, similar to potential energy, kinetic energy, electrical energy and similar. Thus, as of the "Energierhaltungssatz", magical energy can't be "used" or "destroyed". Instead, when for example a spell is used - let's pick fireball for here, the magical energy is converted into thermal energy, the fire/heat of the fireball, and kinetic energy, the movement of the fireball. 
## Conversion
While magical energy can quickly be converted into other energy, reversing the process is quite difficult. Every energy form slowly turns into an unused form of the magical energy, which gathers inside of objects.
## Measurement
### Mana
Mana and other similar words are mostly used to describe unused magical energy, already stored into objects. While some objects, like Mana stones, gather mana quickly and efficiently, others do so only scarcely, some even so little that it mostly can't be used. In more academic fields mana is not only used as a synonym for magical energy, but is also the unity of measurement of the spacial distribution of magical energy. 1 Mana is the equivalent of 10 Petajoule per squaremeter, as of how it's defined mostwhere, however this number may vary on where you are. 
## Magical Fields
Magical energy can also be used to create Magical Fields, another form of energy. Similar to the "Lenzsche Gesetz", this always works against whatever was creating it, so when magic tries to enter these magical fields it gets disrupted and dispelled, 
## The Soul
The Soul of a living being is the strongest of magic. Travelling between planes, another dimension unseen to us, it is the best gatherer of Mana there is, however most of that magical energy is then used to keep the soul living. 
### Dark Magic
Dark Magic uses the Soul's strength and gives up some of its vitality for even stronger, better magical effects. As Souls persist even after death and damage to a soul is damage beyond mortal flesh, dark magic is highly disputed almost everywhere.
## Phthisis
Mana, if not converted into other energy forms, is mostly harmless. However, if gathered in unnatural containers in a too high extent, the medium tries to get rid of that energy, channeling it outside in form of damagin radiation. If such radiation hits human, their flesh withers. This process is called Phthisis.
