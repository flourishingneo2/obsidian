# Day Summary
## What happened?
Woke up late in the morning, I stayed awake far too long yesterday evening, but at least I got to beat [[Marie]]'s [[Block Blast]] record :LiPartyPopper:.  Then we ate a lil something, played [[Super Mario Bros. Deluxe]] for quite a while ([[Niclas]] and [[Samuel]] suck as fuck, but that makes it even funnier) until [[Mathilde Fezer|Oma Hilde]] visited us, I ate way too many of the sweets we got on Christmas. After playing some games and a little more [[Super Mario Bros. Deluxe]], we fought a little, where [[Samuel]] was annoying as hell again, because for some reason he just doesn't manage to control hurting you. In the evening we watched [[Cash Truck]].
