# Day Summary

## What happened?
I was still visiting [[Omi]] and as [[my mother]] was there I didn't have to give [[Omi]] all too much attention. This way I was on the pc almost 6 hours, although I got quite productive. The day before, I decided to start my [[Villain Arc]], so I started in some of the points, told [[Nox]] how bad my mental health is, deinstalled [[Instagram]] and went to do a ToDo-List on [[Todoist]] for my [[Villain Arc|Arc]].

Only other thing that really happened that day was, that we played [[Zoff im Zoo]]


## Edited Files
Deleted Tasks
Deleted all ToDos and moved them to [[Todoist]], as I am on my phone much more frequently.
