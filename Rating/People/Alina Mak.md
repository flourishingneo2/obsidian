# Relation(s)
We're mostly just school comrades, however, because of [[Theater AG]], we have gotten, not friends, but friends of friends.

Currently on the way to a relationship with [[David Sadlon]]
# Rating
## Rating Explanation
### Looks
She keeps on insisting that she looks very good and I will not say she looks bad, but she's definitely not more than a 6/10. A huge factor making her uglier is her having too much fat and her face just having quite some pimples. Additionally, her face card is not very special, she barely has any marcant features. What gives her a little boost is, that she got quite the breasts
### Personality
Well, her personality towards me absolutely sucks, it's better since we got similar friends, but still not very good. When I see her interact with other people however, she seems much more friendly and social than with me, which would be fair enough by itself, but I feel like half her problem with me is not me but that other people from our class have a negative view on me and she doesn't want to be seen with me. 
### Advice
Never have seen her give cooking advice, but tiny advice when your a little stupid every now and then, is given
### Humor
Little humor and when she laughes then at weird moments. She absolutely doesn't get dirty jokes somehow??
### That Skill
Yeah now, she barely gets me.
### Consistency
Relatively consistent, she's mostly very similar to me only sometimes changing when she's not feeling all too good, getting a little better.

# Memory Notes
## Favorite Memory
[[MacBeth]], because it was the first time she really opened up to me.
## Important stuff to remember
DON'T KISS DAVID IN FRONT OF HER
DON'T KISS DAVID IN FRONT OF HER
Her dead grandpa really gave her trauma
90% of her hate are because of her not wanting to be judged by others
## How we met
School, duh
